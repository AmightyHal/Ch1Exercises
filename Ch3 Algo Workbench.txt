if score >= A_score:
print('Your grade is A.')

else:
if score >= C_score:

These lines of code do not have proper indentations

if score >= A_score:
	print('Your grade is A.')
else:
	if score >= B_score:
		print('Your grade is B.')
	else:
		if score >= C_score:
			print('Your grade is C.')
		else:
			if score >= D_score:
				print('Your grade is D.')
			else:
				print('Your grade is F.')

We indent the code to make it easier to see where we start our if else statements and how they progress with the letter grades getting lower.

# First we will have the user defined the two amounts
amount1 = float(input("Enter the 1st amount."))
amount2 = float(input("Enter the 2nd amount."))

# Now we must check the conditions
if amount1 > 10 and amount2 <100
	if amount1 > amount2
		print(f"The greater amount is: {amount1}")
	else:
		print(f"the greater amount is: {amount2}")
	# this will display the greater of the two
else:
	print("conditions are not met.")
	# This will display if amount1 is less than 10 or amount2 is greater than 100
